1.Validate and sanitize all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
2.Encode and escape all outputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
3.Ensure all APIs and routes require proper authentication.
4.Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization.

5.Never store passwords or sensitive tokens in plain text.

6.Use secure hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2 with salt for passwords.

7.Do not log passwords, authentication tokens, or personal user data.

8.Do not hardcode credentials, API keys, or tokens in the source code.

9.Store secrets securely using environment variables or secret vaults.

10.Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit.

11.Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS, TLS 1.2 or higher).

12.Do not expose stack traces or internal system details in error responses.

13.Sanitize log entries to remove sensitive data before logging.

14.Avoid using deprecated, vulnerable, or unmaintained libraries.

15.Keep all dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

16.Use dependency scanning tools to detect security risks.

17.Use secure session management with proper timeouts and renewal.

18.Use secure and HttpOnly cookies for session tokens.

19.Invalidate sessions immediately after logout or timeout.

20.Prevent code injection by avoiding dynamic execution functions like eval() or exec().

21.Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database operations.

22.Enforce strict CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies.

23.Implement CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for state-changing requests.

24.Validate all uploaded files for type, size, and content before saving.

25.Store uploaded files outside publicly accessible directories.

26.Rename uploaded files to prevent overwriting or path traversal attacks.

27.Enforce authentication and rate limiting for all public APIs.

28.Validate all request bodies and parameters against defined schemas.

29.Ensure all endpoints use HTTPS only; no unsecured endpoints allowed.

30.Apply security headers such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and Strict-Transport-Security.

31.Prevent clickjacking and MIME-type sniffing attacks.

32.Disable debug mode and stack trace exposure in production.

33.Do not expose environment variables or system configurations in logs or UI.

34.Restrict access to sensitive configuration and deployment files.
